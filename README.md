# Card Game

This card game is called War. In this game, two players compete against each
other. They are dealt 26 cards (half of a full deck) and they play the cards one
at a time. The person with the higher card (Ace being the highest) wins that hand.
For this version of the game, we will allow ties to happen, and we will not
reshuffle the player's decks. As such, the game is over once all of the cards
have been played, and the winner is whomever won the most hands.

To Install:
1)run node src/main.js from terminal.
